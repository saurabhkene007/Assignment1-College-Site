 <h1 style="color: blue;">Department of Electronics Engineering
</h1><br><div style="text-align: left; padding-left: 10px;">
<p>Department of Electronics Engineering was established in the Year 1988, initially with student intake of 90 students which was further increased to 120 from the Academic Year 1991-92 onwards. Our journey from the Year 1988 to till date has seen us growing in strength and diversifying to cater to the growing demands in higher Education with first year intake strength of 120 UG seats, 18 PG seats and 10 Ph.D. seats till the Academic Year 2020-21. In the Academic year 2021-22, the First Year Electronics Engineering intake strength was reduced to 60 and the remaining 60 seats were offloaded to start a new course in the latest emerging area of Artificial Intelligence and Data Sciences. We started the master’s Program in Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering in the Year 2011-12 and later established the Ph.D Research Centre in Electronics Engineering recognized by University of Mumbai in the Year 2017.</p>
 <p>The Industry Academia partnership plays a vital role in shaping our students from their employability point of view. It is mandatory for every student of our department to undergo internships and trainings at regular schedules during the course of the program, which is facilitated by the department. MoU to this effect has been signed with various corporates and firms like RCF, GNU IT Services, Bit Leaf Technologies, Step-One Digital Solutions, Digi-Lock, Anudip Foundation, etc. Apart from these, many of our students have undergone internship/Training at SIEMENS, Indian Railways, BARC, Godrej & Boyce, HPCL, GAIL, Selec Controls Pvt. Ltd., Metro Rail, Infinity Solutions and many more.</p>
 <p>The vibrancy of the department is reflected through the various technical and/or social activities undertaken by students through forums like EESA (Electronic Engineers Student Association), IETE (Institution of Electronics & Telecommunication Engineers), ISTE (Indian Society for Technical Education) student’s chapter and NSS (National Service Scheme). The rich experience of our faculty members help in channelizing and motivating the aspiring Engineers to participate in multiple activities and tasks so as to be Industry-ready by the time these students graduate out of the department.</p>
